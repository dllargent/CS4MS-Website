        <h1>Mission</h1>
        <p class="w3-large w3-padding">
            Through interactions with students, their educators, and the community, our mission in CS4MS+ is to
            educate and encourage all K-12 students in the exploration of computer science and computational thinking.
        </p>
        <p class="w3-large w3-padding">
            We will accomplish this goal by providing resources, personal insights, and activities that will engage
            younger generations and help reinforce these concepts.
        </p>
        <p class="w3-large w3-padding">
            Furthermore, we will increase community involvement and awareness of the resources provided by
            CS4MS+ to allow our efforts to continue into future semesters.

        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p class="w3-large w3-padding">
            We are Immersive Learning students who worked with neighboring schools to promote their teaching of computer science (CS) and
            computational
            thinking (CT). Research suggests that social and cultural factors may be behind under-representation of many demographics in
            scientific,
            technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields, such as the lack of awareness of STEM opportunities.
            Typical school curriculums expose students to the natural sciences and mathematics more frequently than CS and CT. As a result,
            students have
            little idea what it means to be a computer scientist and lose the opportunity to become one.
        </p>
        <p class="w3-large w3-padding">
            To facilitate this project, we partnered with a variety of local schools. They serve students from diverse backgrounds who
            frequently do not
            have the resources available to participate in CS and CT activities. The focus of this immersive learning course is to expose
            our partners' students,
            particularly underrepresented minorities and females, to CS and CT. This project aims to assist the teachers by curating,
            developing, and documenting
            lessons and activities that incorporate CS and CT experiences for their students.

        <h1>Website Creation</h1>
        <p class="w3-large w3-padding">
            Will English was the original creator of the CS4MS website in the Fall of 2018.
            At this time the website specifically targeted middle-school teachers and gave them the resources and a
            suggested course to succeed.
            The website was revamped in the Fall of 2020 by Drew Thomas and Ben Eger.
            This shifted the website from a focus on middle-school to allowing it to benefit all teachers in the K-12
            system who were interested in adding computer science topics to the classroom.

                            <p>
                                Our team interacted with the students of Northside to help teach concepts of computer science and
                                computational thinking.
                                Mr. Rumple's class of PLTW Computer Science Innovators and Makers was the core focus of our attention, and
                                we would go into his
                                classroom on Wednesdays to help teach the topic of the week according to PLTW course schedule. While doing
                                this, we helped design
                                the course to be more inclusive to different students of different demographics. We were able to lay a good
                                foundation for future classes to come.
                            </p>
                            <h2>Burris Laboratory School</h2>
                            <p>
                                The Burris Team had a great opportunity to create our own teaching plans. The teacher we were working with
                                was very flexible
                                and offered support for any ideas we brought to the table. We decided to have a six lesson outline covering:
                                Introduction to Computer Science,
                                Introduction to How Computers Think, Variables, Conditional Statements, For Loops, and Introduction to
                                Algorithms. Our goal was not
                                necessarily to introduce them to actual coding, rather, to teach them the fundamental concepts of Computer
                                Science and computational thinking.
                                The lessons were staggered, happening roughly every two weeks. We measured our accomplishment over the
                                semester using a Google survey.
                                They were given the same survey on the first and last day of our lessons. We then compared the results to
                                see if there was any notable
                                difference in their understanding of computational thinking.
                            </p>
                            <h2>Muncie Central High School</h2>
                            <p>
                                Our experience with Muncie Central was positive. Expanding the program into high schools was a great
                                undertaking, as teaching
                                principles aimed at a younger age group was the onus of our program. We ended up spending a good deal of
                                time helping hands-on in
                                the classroom and offering resources to the teachers. In our time together away from Muncie Central we
                                collaborated to improve the website
                                and update branding to be more inclusive, expanding to CS4MS+. Another accomplishment was the establishment
                                of CS4MS+ as a Student-run
                                organization to continue our efforts beyond the scope of a single semester.
