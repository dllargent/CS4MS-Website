        <p style="font-size: 29px">
            For the first two or three weeks, we suggest having each student use Google Suite (Google Docs, Sheets,
            and Slides) to make a project about a computer-related topic of their choice. This project would teach
            students how to use the software and would foster independent learning skills.

    <div id="week4Anchor"></div>
    <h1 style="margin: 40px 0 0 20px">Week 4</h1>
    <div class="w3-container w3-padding-large w3-card" style="min-height: 250px; margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px">
        <p style="font-size: 29px">
            After completing the project, start teaching students about the significant impact technology has on our
            everyday lives. This will help students understand the importance of learning the technology-related
            topics presented in this course. Many Indiana state standards for computer science cover the impact
            technology has on our lives. We put this topic earlier in the course because it does not require any special
            prior knowledge and is important for the students to understand as we delve deeper into the course.

        <p style="font-size: 29px">
            During week five, we suggest giving your students a general introduction to computers. This includes two
            main topics: the differences between humans and computers and the differences between hardware and software.
            We also suggest introducing any simple computer knowledge that will help the rest of the course go smoothly.

    <div id="week6Anchor"></div>
    <h1 style="margin: 40px 0 0 20px">Week 6</h1>
    <div class="w3-container w3-padding-large w3-card" style="min-height: 300px; margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px">
        <p style="font-size: 29px">
            By now, students should have a basic understanding of computers, so we suggest introducing
            more involved topics during week 6: troubleshooting, networks, and data. These topics will act as a
            transition into programming and other challenging topics, which will be presented during weeks 7-9.

            For the last three weeks, we suggest starting an <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming" target="_blank">
            Intro to Programming course provided by Khan Academy
        </a>. This free course teaches JavaScript in a fun and simple way.
            During these weeks, you can take breaks to teach the last standards such as algorithms and parallelization.
            The programming course also includes many of the remaining standards, which makes it a great conclusion to
            the class.
