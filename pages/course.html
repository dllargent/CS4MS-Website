            For the first two to three weeks, we suggest each student use Google Suite (Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides) to make a project introducing Google Suite,
            which would teach them how to use the software and scaffold further learning.

            Post-Project, teach students about the significant impact of technology upon their daily lives, a focus of many
            <a href="docs/StandardsResources.pdf" target="_blank">Indiana state standards for computer science</a>.
            The lack of foreknowledge needed may bolster the students' affect if the first project proved difficult.

            During week five, we suggest giving your students a general introduction to computers. This includes two main topics the differences between humans and
            computers and the differences between hardware and software. This also includes simple computer knowledge that will help the rest of the course go
            smoothly. We suggest this because the student should know what theyâ€™re using before they use it.

    <h1 style="margin: 40px 0 0 20px">Week 6</h1>

        <p style="font-size: 29px">
            By now, students should have a basic understanding of computers. Therefore, we suggest starting more involved topics during week six. These topics
            include troubleshooting, networks, and data. These topics are moderately difficult, and so they will act as a transition into more challenging topics.
            We tried to build up as much knowledge as we could before starting these topics.

        <p style="font-size: 29px">
            For the last three weeks, we suggest starting an <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming" target="_blank">
            Intro to Programming course provided by Khan Academy
        </a>. This is free and teaches simple JavaScript while making it fun for middle schoolers.
            During these weeks, you can take breaks to teach the last standards such as algorithms and parallelization. The programming course includes many
            of the standards within it making it a great finish to the class and an easy way to cover them. These are hardest topics to cover which is why we
            spent the weeks before preparing them for such difficult work.
