    <h2>Algorithmic Problem-Solving</h2>
    <p>
        Use the basic steps in algorithmic problem-solving to design solutions (e.g.,
        problem statement and exploration, examination of sample instances, design, implementing a solution,
        testing, and evaluation).

        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p>
                The students should be able to use algorithmic problem-solving skills to design
                a solution for a given problem. This strategy consists of six steps: reading and comprehending the
                problem statement, selecting theoretical concepts that could be applied, describing the problem
                qualitatively, formalizing a solution strategy, testing the solution, and evaluating the effectiveness
                of the solution. They should then be able to discuss their solution with their classmates.

        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p>
                An algorithm is essentially a series of instructions used to complete a
                task. Because computers cannot make decisions without a set of clear instructions, all computers need
                algorithms to complete tasks. Every computer program is made up of algorithms. <br><br>

                People unknowingly use algorithms in many everyday situations. When you wake up in the morning and
                follow a set routine, you are essentially executing the steps of an algorithm you designed to
                prepare you for the day. Other examples of algorithms include recipes, procedures, and instructions. <br><br>
                Designing algorithms helps students to think logically and critically about problems and challenges them
                to design solution. Students should also learn how to use symbols to represent these algorithms because
                this will help students communicate complex ideas.

        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p>
                Algorithms teach us to think critically about how we approach problems in our life: <em>Are our
                strategies for completing tasks efficient and logical? Are we devoting too much time to a certain task?
                Is there a better strategy we could use?</em> Students will benefit from implementing problem-solving
                processes in their future careers and everyday lives.

    <h2>Parallelization</h2>
    <p>Describe the process of parallelization as it relates to problem solving.</p>

        <h3 onclick="toggleActive(this.parentNode)">Long Description</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p>Students should understand the concepts behind parallelization, the use of two or more processors
                (e.g., cores, computers) in combination to solve a single problem. Normally a computer must
                complete tasks in order and one at a time. To increase the speed at which processes can be
                completed, parallel computing can be implemented. Parallel computing aims to break down
                processes into discrete parts that different cores of a processor can work on at the same time.

    <h2>Abstraction and Hierarchy</h2>
    <p>
        Understand the notion of hierarchy and abstraction in computing including high-level languages, translation,

        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p>
                Students should understand that hierarchies are a very common structure in computer software. For
                example, file systems provided by operating systems have a top-level directory that contains
                sub-directories such as "Program Files" and "Documents and Settings". These sub-directories often
                contain their own sub-directories.
                <br><br>
                Abstraction is a method of representing concepts, systems, or problems in a way that hides the complex,
                in-depth details to emphasize the main idea.

        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p>
                Abstraction: Computers at a hardware level are only able to understand binary expressions, and all data
                (e.g., numbers, characters) has to be represented using binary. The exact method a computer uses to
                store this data does not affect the user; therefore, this technical information is hidden from users.
                This an example of abstraction. Computer scientists often use abstraction when writing programs.
                For example, a programmer could create a program that pulls a file from the internet. Perhaps another
                programmer is working on her own project that allows users to draw on pictures from the internet.
                She could incorporate that code into her project to pull pictures from the internet and then write the
                code for drawing on the pictures by herself. If the first programmer wrote his code well, his
                implementation would be abstracted, meaning the second programmer would not need to understand all the
                technical details about how the first programmer's code works to incorporate it into her own code
                project.
                <br><br>
                Hierarchy: Many modern programming languages allow programs to be built from objects,
                which are collections of pieces of data and functions to interact with that data. An example
                object could be called <b>motor-vehicle</b>, which would contain all things common to motor vehicles,
                such as an <i>engine</i>, and functions to interact with the motor vehicle, such as <i>start()</i> and
                <i>drive()</i>. The issue is that <b>motor-vehicle</b> will not contain variables for elements that are
                not common to all motor vehicles, such as doors or the number of wheels. To fix this, programming
                languages allow for the creation of objects such as <b>car</b> or <b>motorcycle</b> which inherit all of
                the attributes of <b>motor-vehicle</b> but also include data specific to themselves. The relationship
                between these types of objects is hierarchical.

                If someone asked you to go see a movie with them and you told them that you could not because you had
                to grade papers, you would be using a form of abstraction. When you said you had to grade papers, you
                left out all of the small details. Instead of saying that you needed to check every answer on the
                quizzes against the answer key, mark down the score for each quiz, and enter those scores into the
                gradebook. You simply abstracted all of those actions into a single action called “grading” because
                all of the details were not of importance to the “end user” or, your friend who asked you to go see a
                movie.

                We will use a math teacher as an example of abstraction and hierarchy. All math teachers at a school are
                teachers, and all teachers are employees. The hierarchy would look like this:
                employee → teacher → math teacher. The school might have a requirement that says all employees need to
                have a bank account set up for direct deposit. However, the specific
                requirements for a math teacher also include “Prepare students for the math portion of
                standardized tests”. Even though all math teachers will need to have a bank account set up, we leave
                those requirements out from the math teacher’s requirements, and allow it to be handled by the employee
                level of the hierarchy. We do not put the math teacher’s requirements in the teacher or employee
                level because not all employees need to prepare students for the math portion of standardized
                tests.

                Computational thinking is a set of problem-solving methods that involve expressing problems and their
                solutions in ways that a computer could execute. Even something as simple as reflecting back on an
                experience multiple times can be considered computational thinking because it is both retrospective and
                recursive.
