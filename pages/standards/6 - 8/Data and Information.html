    <h2>Algorithmic Problem-Solving</h2>
    <p>
        Use the basic steps in algorithmic problem-solving to design solutions (e.g.,
        problem statement and exploration, examination of sample instances, design, implementing a solution,
        testing, and evaluation).

            <p>
                The students should be able to use algorithmic problem-solving skills to design
                a solution for a given problem. This strategy consists of five big steps: read and comprehend the
                problem statement, select theoretical concepts that may be applied, qualitative description of the
                problem, formalization of a solution strategy, and test and description of the solution. They should
                then be able to test and examine their proposed solution and be able discuss it with their classmates.

        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p>
                An algorithm is essentially a series of instructions used to complete a
                task. People use algorithms to complete a wide range of tasks, specifically as the basis for writing
                computer programs. Students should learn how to use symbols to represent algorithms.

    <h2>Parallelization</h2>
    <p>Describe the process of parallelization as it relates to problem solving.</p>

    <div class="accordion-item">
        <h3 onclick="toggleActive(this.parentNode)">Long Description</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p>Students should understand the concepts behind parallelization, the use of two or more processors
                (e.g., cores, computers) in combination to solve a single problem. Normally a computer must
                complete tasks in order and one at a time. To increase the speed at which processes can be
                completed, parallel computing can be implemented. Parallel computing aims to break down
                processes into discrete parts that different cores of a processor can work on at the same time.

        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p>Parallel computing is when we have a process that needs to do multiple tasks at the same time.
                We can use the different cores of a processor to work on different tasks at the same time.
                Normally, instructions would be carried out in sequence, one at a time. Parallelization is the
                process of dividing the process up into tasks that can be accomplished at the same time, so that
                the computer does not need to wait as long to move on.</p>

    <h2>Abstraction and Hierarchy</h2>
    <p>
        Understand the notion of hierarchy and abstraction in computing including high-level languages, translation,
        instruction set, and logic circuits.
    </p>
    <div class="accordion-item">

        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p>
                Students should understand that hierarchies are a very common structure in computer software. For
                example, file systems provided by operating systems have a top-level directory that contains
                sub-directories such as "Program Files" and "Documents and Settings". These sub-directories often
                contain their own sub-directories.
                <br><br>
                Abstraction is a method of representing concepts, systems, or problems in a way that hides the complex,
                in-depth details to emphasize the main idea.

        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p>
                Abstraction: Computers at a hardware level are only able to understand binary expressions, and all data
                (e.g., numbers, characters) has to be represented using binary. The exact method a computer stores this
                data does not affect the user; therefore, this technical information is hidden from users. This an
                example of abstraction. Computer scientists often use abstraction when writing a program.
                For example, a programmer could create a program that pulls a file from the internet then give the
                program to another programmer. This second programmer could incorporate that program into their own
                program without understanding all of the complexities of the first programmer's code. The implementation
                of the program to pull the file from the internet is abstracted, meaning the second programmer does not
                need to know the technical portions of the first program in order to access files on the internet.
                <br><br>
                Hierarchy: Many modern programming languages allow programs to be built from objects,
                which are collections of pieces of data and functions to interact with that data. An example
                object could be called <b>motor-vehicle</b>, which would contain all things common to motor vehicles,
                such as an <i>engine</i>, and functions to interact with the motor vehicle, such as <i>start()</i> and
                <i>drive()</i>. The issue is that <b>motor-vehicle</b> will not contain variables for elements that are
                not common to all motor vehicles, such as doors or the number of wheels. To fix this, programming
                languages allow for the creation of objects such as <b>car</b> or <b>motorcycle</b> which inherit all of
                the attributes of <b>motor-vehicle</b> but also include data specific to themselves. The relationship
                between these types of objects is hierarchical.

                We will use a Math teacher as an example of Abstraction and Hierarchy. All Math teachers at a school are
                teachers, and all teachers are employees. The hierarchy would look like
                Employee → Teacher → Math Teacher. The school might have a requirement that says all employees need to
                have a bank account set up so that they can get their paychecks from the school. However, the
                requirements for a Math teacher might only include “Prepare students for the Math portion of the
                standardised tests”. Even though all Math Teachers will need to have a bank account set up, we leave
                those requirements out from the Math teacher’s requirements, and allow it to be handled by the Employee
                level of the hierarchy. And we do not put the Math teacher’s requirements in the Teacher or Employee
                level, because not all Employees need to prepare students for the Math portion of the Standardised
                tests.

                If someone asked you to go see a movie with them, and you told them that you could not because you had
                to grade papers, you would be using a form of abstraction. When you said you had to grade papers, you
                left out all of the small details. Instead of saying that you needed to check every answer on the
                quizzes against the answer key, mark down the score for each quiz, and enter those scores into the
                gradebook. You simply abstracted all of those actions into a single action called “grading” because
                all of the details were not of importance to the “end user” or, your friend who asked you to go see a
                movie.

                Students are able to determine small steps in a large process. This could be applied to large projects
                or homework assignments as students will be able to recognize small progresses leading to a goal.
                Students will also be able to visualize the complexities of a large system via its parts.

            <p>
                Computational thinking is a set of problem-solving methods that involve expressing problems and their
                solutions in ways that a computer could execute. Even something as simple as reflecting back on an
                experience multiple times can be considered computational thinking because it is both retrospective and
                recursive.
