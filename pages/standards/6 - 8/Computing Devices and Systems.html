                When most people think of a computer, they think of computer hardware. The mouse, the monitor, the keyboard - these are all pieces of hardware. Software, on the other hand, cannot be seen. Software is the code that the computer runs on. Machine code, assembly code, and written code are examples of software.

They should have a basic understanding of the main difference between a neural network, and know that computers don't normally use these processes to handle information. Students should have a basic understanding of how computers learn, and they should understand that a computer cannot feel emotion: a computer can only simulate emotion that human programmers code into it.

            <p>
                Artificial intelligence is built by humans to mimic human behavior not the structure of the brain, which is analog not digital like a computer. Artificial intelligence is built upon pattern recognition over lots and lots of data. Artificial intelligence is much less pliable than human intelligence, being designed to learn just one thing. Artificial intelligence also lacks the bias attached to human decision making.
