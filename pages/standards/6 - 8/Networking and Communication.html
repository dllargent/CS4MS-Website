                Students should be able to work collaboratively, with their peers, to design and develop
                products, demonstrating knowledge from the rest of the curriculum. They should also be
                able to choose the right publication method for their product and be able to present their

                knowledge of technological tools that will aid them in collaboration. This
                can be applied to any subject as they might not have been exposed to tools
                they could use to solve problems.

            <p>
                Any large scale task involving computers is going to be collaborative.
                Therefore, it is imperative that students are able to communicate with
                each other well.

                Students will benefit from this standard by gaining an understanding of
                respectful collaboration.  This can be applied to English as a peer
                editing skill and to group work as communication techniques.  Students
                will also learn how to gracefully accept others’ opinions to improve
                their work.
