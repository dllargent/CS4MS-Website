            <h2>Algorithmic Problem-Solving</h2>
            <p> Use the basic steps in algorithmic problem-solving to design solutions (e.g.,
                problem statement and exploration, examination of sample instances, design, implementing a solution,
                testing, and evaluation).</p>

                <h3>Long Description</h3>
                <div class="accordion-content">
                    <p>The students should be able to use algorithmic problem-solving skills to design
                        a solution for a given problem. This strategy consists of five big steps: read and comprehend the
                        problem statement, select theoretical concepts that may be applied, qualitative description of the
                        problem, formalization of a solution strategy, and test and description of the solution. They should
                        then be able to test and examine their proposed solution and be able discuss it with their classmates.

                <h3>Explanation For Teachers</h3>
                <div class="accordion-content">
                    <p>An algorithm is essentially a series of instructions used to complete a
                        task. People use algorithms to complete a wide range of tasks, specifically as the basis for writing
                        computer programs. Students should learn how to use symbols to represent algorithms.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Without computers, you could make worksheets with a simple problem on it and have the
                            students write an algorithm for it.</li>
                        <li>Explore the Codebreakers of Bletchley Park and the Enigma Machine used during World War II.
                            (This also applies to IC.2).</li>
                        <li>Use Alice Programming as part of story-telling in English or Social Studies courses (Also
                            applies to DI.5, PA.3, NC.1, NC.2)
