                problem statement and exploration, examination of sample instances, design, implementing a solution,
                testing, and evaluation).</p>

                    problem, formalization of a solution strategy, and test and description of the solution. They should
                    then be able to test and examine their proposed solution and be able discuss it with their classmates.

                    <p>An algorithm is essentially a series of instructions used to complete a

            <p>
                <b>Short Description</b>: Describe the process of parallelization as it relates to problem solving.<br><br>
                <b>Explanation For Teachers</b>: Parallel computing is when we have a process that needs to do multiple tasks at the same
                time. We can use the
                different cores of a processor to work on different tasks at the same time. Normally, instructions would be carried out in
                sequence, one at a time.
                Parallelization is the process of dividing the process up into tasks that can be accomplished at the same time, so that the
                computer does not need
                to wait as long to move on.

                statistical reasoning to make
                conclusions about an entire population. Data is an important part of statistics.

        <div class="w3-container w3-padding-large w3-card">
            <p>
                <b>Short Description</b>: Understand the notion of hierarchy and abstraction in computing including high-level languages,
                translation, instruction set,
                and logic circuits.<br><br>
                <b>Explanation For Teachers</b>: Abstraction: Computers at a hardware level are only able to understand binary expressions
                and all data (e.g., numbers,
                characters) has to be represented using binary. The way in which a computer stores this data does not affect the user,
                therefore it is hidden from them.
                Hierarchy: Many modern programming languages allow the program to be built from objects, which are collections of pieces of
                data and functions to be
                able to interact with that data. Most of these are organized in a pyramid like fashion similar to a hierarchy.

                to support learning and research.<br><br>
                <b>Explanation For Teachers</b>: Computational thinking is a set of problem-solving methods that involve expressing problems
                and their solutions in ways
                that a computer could execute. Even something as simple as reflecting back on an experience multiple times can be considered
                computational thinking
                because it is both retrospective and recursive.

                <b>Explanation For Teachers</b>: When most people think of a computer, they think of computer hardware. The mouse, the
                monitor, the keyboard - these
                are all pieces of hardware. Software, on the other hand, cannot be seen. Software is the code that the computer runs on.
                Machine code, assembly code,
                and written code are examples of software.

                <b>Explanation For Teachers</b>: Troubleshooting is a logical thinking process/method that helps discover the source of an
                error. Students will be
                able to learn troubleshooting techniques that they can use in computers and their everyday lives. This will enable students

                <b>Explanation For Teachers</b>: A computer network is like a tree or web that connects multiple computers with each other.
                There are both wired and
                wireless connections. Students are able to understand how information is communicated through a network, applicable to all

                intelligence and ways we can
                communicate. As well as ways in which computers use models of intelligent behavior.<br><br>
                <b>Explanation For Teachers</b>: Artificial intelligence is built by humans to mimic human behavior not the structure of the
                brain, which is analog not
                digital like a computer. Artificial intelligence is built upon pattern recognition over lots and lots of data. Artificial
                intelligence is much less
                pliable than human intelligence, being designed to learn just one thing. Artificial intelligence also lacks the bias
                attached to human decision making.
