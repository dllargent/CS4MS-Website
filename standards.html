    <p style="font-size: 29px">
    	<b>Short Description</b>: Use the basic steps in algorithmic problem-solving to design solutions (e.g., problem statement and exploration, 
        examination of sample instances, design, implementing a solution, testing, and evaluation).<br><br>

     <b>Explanation For Teachers</b>: An algorithm is essentially a series of instructions used to complete a task. People use algorithms to 
        complete a wide range of tasks, specifically as the basis for writing computer programs. Students should learn how to use symbols to represent algorithms.

    <p style="font-size: 29px">
    <b>Short Description</b>: Describe the process of parallelization as it relates to problem solving.<br><br>
    <b>Explanation For Teachers</b>: Parallel computing is when we have a process that needs to do multiple tasks at the same time. We can use the 
        different cores of a processor to work on different tasks at the same time. Normally, instructions would be carried out in sequence, one at a time. 
        Parallelization is the process of dividing the process up into tasks that can be accomplished at the same time, so that the computer does not need 
        to wait as long to move on.

    <b>Short Description</b>: Represent data in various ways (e.g., numbers, text, pictures) and using visual representations of problems and data.<br><br>
    <b>Explanation For Teachers</b>: We collect data from samples, organize this data using graphs and charts, and then utilize statistical reasoning to make 
        conclusions about an entire population. Data is an important part of statistics.

    <p style="font-size: 29px">
     <b>Short Description</b>: Understand the notion of hierarchy and abstraction in computing including high-level languages, translation, instruction set, 
        and logic circuits.<br><br>
     <b>Explanation For Teachers</b>: Abstraction: Computers at a hardware level are only able to understand binary expressions and all data (e.g., numbers, 
        characters) has to be represented using binary. The way in which a computer stores this data does not affect the user, therefore it is hidden from them. 
        Hierarchy: Many modern programming languages allow the program to be built from objects, which are collections of pieces of data and functions to be 
        able to interact with that data. Most of these are organized in a pyramid like fashion similar to a hierarchy.

    <p style="font-size: 29px">
    <b>Short Description</b>: Demonstrate interdisciplinary applications of computational thinking and interact with content-specific models and simulations 
        to support learning and research.<br><br>
    <b>Explanation For Teachers</b>: Computational thinking is a set of problem-solving methods that involve expressing problems and their solutions in ways 
        that a computer could execute. Even something as simple as reflecting back on an experience multiple times can be considered computational thinking 
        because it is both retrospective and recursive.

    <p style="font-size: 29px">
    <b>Short Description</b>: Demonstrate an understanding of the relationship between hardware and software.<br><br>
    <b>Explanation For Teachers</b>: When most people think of a computer, they think of computer hardware. The mouse, the monitor, the keyboard - these 
        are all pieces of hardware. Software, on the other hand, cannot be seen. Software is the code that the computer runs on. Machine code, assembly code, 
        and written code are examples of software.

     <b>Short Description</b>: Apply troubleshooting strategies to identify and solve routine hardware and software problems that occur during everyday computer use.<br><br>
     <b>Explanation For Teachers</b>: Troubleshooting is a logical thinking process/method that helps discover the source of an error. Students will be 
        able to learn troubleshooting techniques that they can use in computers and their everyday lives. This will enable students to understand how a 
        problem arose and not just the symptoms of this problem.

    <p style="font-size: 29px">
    <b>Short Description</b>: Describe the major components and functions of computer systems and network.<br><br>
    <b>Explanation For Teachers</b>: A computer network is like a tree or web that connects multiple computers with each other. There are both wired and 
        wireless connections. Students are able to understand how information is communicated through a network, applicable to all networks. They will be 
        able to use this information to build their own networks, as well as use already existing networks to their greatest capability.

    <p style="font-size: 29px">
     <b>Short Description</b>: Describe what distinguishes humans from machines focusing on human intelligence versus machine intelligence and ways we can 
        communicate. As well as ways in which computers use models of intelligent behavior.<br><br>
     <b>Explanation For Teachers</b>: Artificial intelligence is built by humans to mimic human behavior not the structure of the brain, which is analog not 
        digital like a computer. Artificial intelligence is built upon pattern recognition over lots and lots of data. Artificial intelligence is much less 
        pliable than human intelligence, being designed to learn just one thing. Artificial intelligence also lacks the bias attached to human decision making.

        design, develop, and publish data, accomplish a variety of tasks, and solve problems.<br><br>
    <b>Explanation For Teachers</b>: Students should be able to pick the right method of processing to do an activity. Students will encounter data in science 
        and math courses that may need to be manipulated.  This standard will help students understand computer applications for presentations that could be 
        used in all courses, including presentations for English courses.

    <b>Short Description</b>: Implement problem solutions using a programming language that includes looping behavior, conditional statements, logic, 
        expressions, variables, and functions.<br><br>
    <b>Explanation For Teachers</b>: Students should be able to use computational thinking to solve problems; i.e. logic puzzles. Basic programming is 
        able to teach students valuable problem solving skills that can help them in every course. Alongside this, students will be required to understand 
        programming syntax which can help in understanding English and mathematical symbols.

        collaborative techniques along with knowledge of technological tools that will aid them in collaboration. This can be applied to any subject as 
        they might not have been exposed to tools they could use to solve problems.
